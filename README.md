Just a small gravity simulation, this is mainly to look pretty and not to be 100% scientifically accurate

compile using `make` 

run with ./Simulation [type] [count]

the type can either be -cpu or -gpu which will make this Simulation run on the respective processor
The count is just the amount of particles.
